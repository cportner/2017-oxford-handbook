Notes to editors

Structure:
- Split Bargaining Power and Sex Preferences into two separate sections

Larger edits:

Introduction:

- Added outline of chapter

Sub-Saharan Africa:

- The argument about fertility and farm size is theoretical. 
There are no solid tests of the arguments, mainly because getting measuring 
land access is very difficult at an individual level.
I started a paper on land access and fertility in Bangladesh, but we had
to leave it again because there are no solid data.
I have added a new paragraph that discuss some of the issues with 
understanding the relationship between land access and fertility.

Sex Preferences:

- Main edit is a better explanation of the paper on prospective 
sex preference.
- Also added footnote with text from sex preference questions

Policies:

- Added information on the health scare in Zambia
- Matlab is only large long-running family planning experiment.
Since the paragraph is about long-run effects there is little
to chose between.
- Progesa/Oportunidades does not have a family planning component
- Added the full original name for the Matlab research center:
the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh
and changed the text to reflect how they are now known: icddr,b 
(it is supposed to be lower-case)
