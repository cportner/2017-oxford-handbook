\section{Introduction}

Despite a common perception that fertility is very high in developing countries,
the truth is substantially more complicated.
Figure \ref{fig:TFR} shows that there has been an astonishing decline in total 
fertility rate (TFR) in developing countries over the last half century.%
\footnote{
TFR is the number of children a women entering her reproductive life
would have if she had children following the age-specific fertility
rates observed at that point in time.
Hence, it is composite or snapshot measure of current fertility
behavior.
}
Half a decade ago, TFR was around 7 children, with the exception
of TK.
The most recent data show, however, that, with the exception of 
Sub-Saharan African, TFR is now either below or only slightly 
above the replacement level of 2.1.
Despite this rapid decline in fertility population size is still
growing in many of these regions because there are still many
more young people than older people and these young people either
have not entered reproductive age or are just starting out.

\end{figure}

If fertility levels are close to identical across developing and
developed countries and there is rapid urbanization and increasing
labor force participation among women do we even need a developing 
country version of this chapter?%
\footnote{
TK references on urbanization and labor force particpation.
}
The goal of this chapter is to highlight the areas in which a
separate focus on developing countries is still relevant,
what the recent developments in research has been, and
most importantly, what I consider to be the main
outstanding issues.

[still need policy discussion; this seems kind of a rambling list]
The most important issues from a policy standpoint is why the 
fertility decline in Sub-Saharan Africa have moved at a much
slower pace than the other regions.
Sub-Saharan Africa now has an average TFR that is about twice
as large as the other regions.
Furthermore, we still know relatively little about determinants
of timing of births in developing countries.
People in most developing countries are also still subject to
higher risk of shocks, be that from weather, health, or political,
but we still have little idea of how people respond to the level
of risk and the occurrence of shocks.
Finally, both in developed and developing countries we have
mostly treated fertility decisions as separate from other
household decision and preferences [ehh, Becker theory!].
We still need to know more about how husband and wife decides
on fertility if they are have different preferences 
and how allocation decisions across all household member are
related to fertility decisions.
A prime example that I will treat separately is the role
of son preferences in fertility decisions.
