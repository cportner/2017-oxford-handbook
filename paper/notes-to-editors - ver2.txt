# Notes to editors for version 2

## Introduction

- The graph only includes developing countries as per the World Bank definition.
- UN uses 2.1 for replacement-level fertility across all countries, so I am
sticking with 2.1.

## Sub-Saharan Africa

- [TK example of differences across Sub-Saharan Africa as footnote]
- Added paragraph with two studies on the effects of land security to
the end of the land discussion.
- There is, indeed, a very large literature on the positive relationship between
mother's education and child health. 
Only three of them try to understand exactly why it is.
All three suggest that health knowledge is the main driver rather than some of
the other positive effects of education (higher income to name one).
I have split the sentence and expanded the discussion in the footnote.
