# Notes to editors for version 2

## Introduction

- The graph only includes developing countries as per the World Bank definition.
- UN uses 2.1 for replacement-level fertility across all countries, so I am
sticking with 2.1.

## Sub-Saharan Africa

- [TK example of differences across Sub-Saharan Africa as footnote]
- Added paragraph with two studies on the effects of land security to
the end of the land discussion.
- There is, indeed, a very large literature on the positive relationship between
mother's education and child health. 
Only three of them try to understand exactly why it is.
All three suggest that health knowledge is the main driver rather than some of
the other positive effects of education (higher income to name one).
I have split the sentence and expanded the discussion in the footnote.
- I have also rewritten the paragraph introducing the effects of education
to highlight that most of the literature is on the association.
I added a sentence on the newer literature trying to estimate causal
relationships.
- I cannot find any papers reproducing the Ainsworth, Beegle, and Nyamete 
paper, but I do not see any evidence that the pattern is fundamentally
changed.
If anything, the difference is likely stronger given the strong decline
in fertility in urban areas of Ethiopia.

## Bargaining Power

- Added more discussion of West Africa and additional references.

## Sex Preferences

- On Underreporting: I have added a more recent paper by Goodkind 2011
that show the same results but uses a different method.
- Added newer reference on son preference. 
Part of the problem is that the lastest version of NFHS is 2005-2006.
