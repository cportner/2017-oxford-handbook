\section{Risk and Insurance}

[treat mortality in general as a shock here? \citet{olsen80}]

One of the defining characteristics of developing
countries is that risk to life and livelihood are 
most more prevalent and less well insured against
compared to developed countries.
We can split the fertility response to this fact
into two categories: how people respond to the
shocks and how people respond to the underlying
risk of experiencing a shock.
This distinction is important because it is possible 
that the responses run in opposite directions, which
may result in no apparent response to shocks if the
underlying risk is not controlled for, or a focus
on treating the shock rather than the underlying
risk if both move in the same direction.

Moreover, fertility rates declined by about 34 \% during 1974–1975,
before increasing by 17 \% in the post-famine years, thereby partially
offsetting the famine’s effect (Razzaque 1988).
